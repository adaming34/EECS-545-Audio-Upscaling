"""
Speech Command Recognition with torchaudio
******************************************

This tutorial will show you how to correctly format an audio dataset and
then train/test an audio classifier network on the dataset.

Colab has GPU option available. In the menu tabs, select “Runtime” then
“Change runtime type”. In the pop-up that follows, you can choose GPU.
After the change, your runtime should automatically restart (which means
information from executed cells disappear).

First, let’s import the common torch packages such as
`torchaudio <https://github.com/pytorch/audio>`__ that can be installed
by following the instructions on the website.

# Uncomment the following line to run in Google Colab

# datasets of 35 commands spoken by different people. The dataset
# ``SPEECHCOMMANDS`` is a ``torch.utils.data.Dataset`` version of the
# dataset. In this dataset, all audio files are about 1 second long (and
# so about 16000 time frames long).
#
# The actual loading and formatting steps happen when a data point is
# being accessed, and torchaudio takes care of converting the audio files
# to tensors. If one wants to load an audio file directly instead,
# ``torchaudio.load()`` can be used. It returns a tuple containing the
# newly created tensor along with the sampling frequency of the audio file
# (16kHz for SpeechCommands).
#
# Going back to the dataset, here we create a subclass that splits it into
# standard training, validation, testing subsets.

# too much of the classification power.
#
# We don’t need to apply other transformations here. It is common for some
# datasets though to have to reduce the number of channels (say from
# stereo to mono) by either taking the mean along the channel dimension,
# or simply keeping only one of the channels. Since SpeechCommands uses a
# single channel for audio, this is not needed here.

# Define the Network
# ------------------
#
# For this tutorial we will use a convolutional neural network to process
# the raw audio data. Usually more advanced transforms are applied to the
# audio data, however CNNs can be used to accurately process the raw data.
# The specific architecture is modeled after the M5 network architecture
# described in `this paper <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.00087.pdf>`__. An
# important aspect of models processing raw audio data is the receptive
# field of their first layer’s filters. Our model’s first filter is length
# 80 so when processing audio sampled at 8kHz the receptive field is
# around 10ms (and at 4kHz, around 20 ms). This size is similar to speech
# processing applications that often use receptive fields ranging from
# 20ms to 40ms.

# Conclusion
# ----------
#
# In this tutorial, we used torchaudio to load a dataset and resample the
# signal. We have then defined a neural network that we trained to
# recognize a given command. There are also other data preprocessing
# methods, such as finding the mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC),
# that can reduce the size of the dataset. This transform is also
# available in torchaudio as ``torchaudio.transforms.MFCC``.
